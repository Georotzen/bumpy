Quick appetizer and first tutorial on scientific computing with Python
using examples from basic physics.

## Contents

 * Part I introduces the fundamental Python syntax for
   variables, loops, if-tests, arrays, plotting, files, and classes,
   using a simple physics formula as example.
 * Part II is a real physics application involving analysis of mechanical
   vibrations. Besides showing how typical scientific Matlab-style scripts
   look in Python, this example also introduces more advanced concepts
   like flexible storage of objects in lists and files, downloading
   data from web sites, user input via the command line, unit testing,
   symbolic mathematics, and modules.

## Goal

The goal of the tutorials is to bring the reader quickly up to speed
with how Matlab-style programming (with functions of one variable)
can be done in Python. With such basic background, it is easier to
follow scientific courses and teaching material that apply Python as
programming language. The tutorials are application-driven and brief.
For further and more detailed information on scientific computing
with Python we have compiled
a [list of much more detailed tutorials and books](http://hplgit.github.io/bumpy/doc/pub/._bumpy010.html#app:resources).
