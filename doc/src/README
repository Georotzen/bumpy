This directory tree contains the source code of two documents:

 * A very basic introduction to scientific programming in Python (basics)
 * Demonstration of Python for a real scientific application (bumpy)

There are two versions of the documents:

 * Text
 * Slides

The source is written in DocOnce. The text versions are in
basics.do.txt and bumpy.do.txt. The slides are in the subdirectory
lec-bumpy with wrapper files for title, author,
etc. in lectures-basics.do.txt ad lectures-bumpy.do.txt.

A script make.sh compiles the two texts, while make_lec.sh makes the
two slides collections.

All compiled documents in HTML, PDF, and Sphinx format are copied to
../pub for publishing on the web.
